### Hi, I'm Ferdi!
I was born and raised in Germany, but have since then lived in three different countries, including Spain, United States and the United Kingdom. In general, I am a very curious person and enjoy discovering unknown territories, be it a new culture or country, or acquiring a completely new skill set such as data analytics.\n  
    
From an academical standpoint, my background lies in business. A 4-year undergraduate degree at IE University in Madrid has taught me the fundamentals of the business world, while helping me to discover my quantitative nature and passion for analytics.\n 
  
As a consequence of this passion, I decided to dive into the coding world next to my business studies. After being introduced to Python programming at Cornell University, I wanted to take my coding skills even further and participated in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in New York, which taught me everything around Machine Learning. Part of the curriculum were five real-world machine learning projects, which can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/ferdiwo/Metis-2019).\n  
  
After having experienced the power of machine learning and data-driven decision making, I decided my path would be to become a data professional in the business world. To help me achieve this vision, I am currently reading for a Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School with an expected graduation in 2022.\n
