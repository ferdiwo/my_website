### Quick Introduction
Hi, I'm Ferdinand! name is Ferdinand**, I am **23 years old** and was born in **Frankfurt, Germany**. I am a very curious and outgoing person and just love to getting to know new people and their cultures.\ 
    
As a result of this passion, I decided to leave Germany right after my High School degree to study in Madrid and dive into the Spanish culture.\ 
   
Now, I am looking forward to my next adventure in London and the challenge to dive into the data sphere.\
