<h1>Background</h1>
<p>During my time at LBS, our professor provided us with an article (<a href="https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have">The Racial Factor: Thereâ€™s 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?</a>) that compared the % of Trump votes in each US county with the respective % of population (by county) that is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The graph was intended to generate some insights regarding the willingness of Trump voters towards being vaccinated against Covid-19. Furthermore, the graph looked at the population of each county, as larger counties usually have a bigger influence on elections, as well as on fighting Covid-19.</p>
<p>The graph generated some really interesting insights and I decided to reproduce the graph by using R coding.</p>

<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
<p>Before I was able to conduct any analysis, I had to collect data by using three different sources:. Vaccination by county: <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">CDC data</a>
2. Election Results: <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ">County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020</a>
3. Population estimate: <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232">Population by county</a></p>

<p>The plan is to setup 3 separate dataframes for population, vaccination rate and election results and ultimately merging the dataframe by using the fips variable. Before joining the dataframes, I had to clean the data and make sure it has exactly the information I need for my analysis. </p>

<p>First, a new dataframe needs to be created to only include Donald Trump votes. Subsequently, the no. of votes needs to be expressed as a percentage of the overall votes in each district/county.</p>

<p>A new dataframe is created that only contains the county and percentage of population being fully vaccinated on September 2 (last available date).</p>

<div id="summary-of-findings" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary of findings</h2>
<p>The graph shows a negative correlation between Trump votes and the vaccination status. More precise, in counties with more trump voters, a comparably lower proportion of the population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Hence, Trump voters seem to be rather reluctant to Covid-19 vaccinations. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we can see that only very few counties are above the herd immunity threshold, while many counties still have less than 5% of the population vaccinated. </p>
<p>The points are proportional in size to the county population, therefore, larger points display larger counties. Looking at the graph, we see a lot of large counties are clustered around 50% vaccination status and therefore above the target of 53.9%. Also, most of the large counties were rather against Trumpm with often less than 40% of the population voting for Trump. </p>
