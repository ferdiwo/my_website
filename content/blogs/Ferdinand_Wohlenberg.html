<h3>Hi, I’m Ferdinand!</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Germany, but have since then lived in three different countries, including Spain, United States and the United Kingdom. My curiosity for new cultures and people has impacted me my whole life and still drives me to live in many more countries during my early career. </p>
<p>From an academical standpoint, my background lies in business. A 4-year undergraduate degree at IE University in Madrid has taught me the fundamentals of the business world, while helping me to discover my quantitative nature and passion for analytics. As a result of this passion, I am currently reading for a Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School with an expected graduation in 2022. </p>
<p>During my early career, I have gathered experience in Consulting, Venture Capital and Entrepreneurship. Especially fast-paced environments appeal to me, which is why I am looking to go back into Consulting after graduating from LBS. The large variety of projects in combination with its bright workforce make Consulting the perfect entry-level job for me to further develop my professional and personal skillset. </p>
